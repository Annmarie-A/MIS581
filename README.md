# MIS581 MIS581 Capstone Project 
This Capstone Project focuses on analyzing the preferred fees for single-use plastic bags, paper bags, and hot and cold cups of the residents of the city of Toronto, Canada. The mean fees were analyzed to determine if respondents prefer a single fee for these various single-use plastic items or if respondents prefer a different fee across these single-use plastic products. Additional respondents’ demographics were analyzed to examine if the preferred fees differ among the various age brackets and to determine if any of the demographic factors influenced respondents’ support for additional bans on single-use cutlery, straws, and foam takeaway containers.
